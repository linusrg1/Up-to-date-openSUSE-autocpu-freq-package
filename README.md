# Up-to-date-openSUSE-autocup-freq-package
This is a place where I will host an up-to-date RPM of the auto-cpufreq openSUSE RPM. I will try to keep it as up to date as I can. This RPM will always be based off of the latest stable version of auto-cpufreq, not a beta/alfa version of it. 
Thank you to AdnanHodzic's amazing efforts for creating auto-cpufreq. This github repo simply exists to provide openSUSE users with an up-todate native version of auto-cpufreq. I am only showing the RPM here as my knowledge of source code as well as github, is very limited in general. If anyone would like to suggest to me what I could add to this repository to help increase people's trust in this package, feel free.

Old version of the openSUSE auto-cpufreq package that was used to create this up-to-date one
Thanks to a user on the openSUSE Discord/IRC/Matrix server group for explaining to me how to update an RPM.
